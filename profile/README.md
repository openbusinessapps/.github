# OpenBusinessApps

**About OpenBusinessApps**
**OpenBusinessApps** is an open-source organization dedicated to collaboration around existing ERPs and business applications. We bring together developers, users, and enthusiasts to contribute to open-source projects like **Axelor**, **Odoo**, **Dolibarr**, and other popular ERP solutions.
Our goal is to facilitate the creation of **modules**, **extensions**, **bug fixes**, and **enhancements** for these ERPs, helping the community improve their business management tools. We promote interoperability and customization of ERPs to better meet the needs of businesses of all sizes.
**OpenBusinessApps** is a collaborative platform, independent of the companies behind these ERPs, where the community takes charge of contributions and development.


**Our Mission**

Our mission is to:

- Contribute to open-source ERP projects by adding **extensions**, **modules**, and **bug fixes**.
- Provide a platform for **community contributions** on ERPs like **Axelor**, **Odoo**, **Dolibarr**, and others.
- Improve **interoperability** between different ERP systems.
- Create resources and tools to simplify ERP development and customization.
- Encourage collaboration between different ERP user and developer communities.

**Why OpenBusinessApps?**

Existing ERPs like **Axelor**, **Odoo**, **Dolibarr**, and others are powerful, but often each company has specific needs that are not fully covered by the base features. By collaborating within **OpenBusinessApps**, we want to:

- Facilitate the addition of new **features** and **extensions** to these ERPs.
- Help **fix bugs** and improve the performance of these systems.
- Create a space where businesses can find customized solutions tailored to their specific needs, all within an open-source framework.
- Provide tools and resources that allow developers to easily contribute to ERP improvement.

We believe that open collaboration is the best way to make ERPs more accessible, flexible, and powerful for all businesses.
